### Development process

This app does not require database since it's an information application that can be used for searching target hotels,restaurants and attractions based on criteria.
That being said, this app is built with React for the frontend to display information fetched from multiple APIs.

The UI has multiple components.

1. Header
2. List
3. Map
4. PlaceDetails
